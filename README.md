# DNA-Analyzer

This program takes a DNA string and computes the GC content of that string. Object-Oriented practices were used by creating different methods to perform the tasks required by the project. These methods were called within the “main” method to calculate the GC content. The program also includes an error system, printing a warning if the DNA string contains invalid bases.
