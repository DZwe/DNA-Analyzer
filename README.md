# DNA-Analyzer

This program takes a DNA string and computes the %G~C content of that string. Object-Oriented practices were used by creating different methods to perform the tasks required by the project. These methods were called within the “main” method to calculate the %G~C content. The program also includes an error system, printing a warning if the DNA string contains invalid bases.
